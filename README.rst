# pyKLIP-CHARIS-Tutorial-Data

This is a repository hosting a small dataset for the tutorial of the `pyKLIP-CHARIS post-procesing pipeline <https://pyklip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/instruments/CHARIS.html>`_.

pyKLIP-CHARIS post-processing pipeline is a Python library that reduces high contrast imaging data for the Coronagraphic High Angular Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (CHARIS) used with the SCExAO project on the Subaru Telescope. The pipeline is a part of the `pyKLIP <https://pyklip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ package (`Wang et al. 2015 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ascl.soft06001W>`_), a Python library dedicated to the reduction of direct imaging data of exoplanets, brown dwarfs and disks.
